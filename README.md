This is a work in progress personal finance app, that I'm mostly building as a learning project, but also as something I would myself use as an alternative to some of the apps currently on the market.
Focus of the current build is to support UK banks, and have views and analytics on user accounts (current accounts, credit cards, savings, etc.), transactions and budgets.
#### Status
Build is in early stages and short term objective is to provide basic accounts and transactions views
#### Tech stack
**Back-end:** ExpressJS, Postgres, Sequelize, PassportJS, Typescript
**Front-end:** ReactJS, MUI (Material UI), Redux, Typescript

The app use [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) as an open-banking library to interface with the different financial institutions.
